# LDSSim

LDSSim is a set of python codes that implements the protocol for computational simulation to analyze chaos bahavior of dynamical system. The system represents reversible protein phosphorylation models described by a set of Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reactions. Large-scale parameter search of a deterministic model and clustering analysis are conducted to find motif structures commonly shared in an ensemble of chaos parameter set. Stochastic simulation is performed to elucidate how these motifs work to generate autonomous chaos at the molecular level. This protocol is generally applicable to investigate various complex behaviors of dynamical systems.

See Yamaguchi et al. (2021) for the detail of this procotol.
